# CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTIVE-
Importing Libraries: You start by importing necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and others for data analysis and visualization.

Importing Data: You read a CSV file named 'dataset12M.csv' into a DataFrame called DATA_ to work with the data.

Cohort Analysis: There is a section of code related to cohort analysis, where you calculate cohort indices and visualize retention rates using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Preprocessing Data: You preprocess the data, including calculating the TotalSum column, converting the InvoiceDate to the datetime format, and calculating Recency, Frequency, and MonetaryValue for each customer.

Churn Analysis: You calculate the 'Churn' column based on a specified threshold and visualize the distribution of churned and non-churned customers.

Customer Segmentation: You segment customers based on RFM scores into different categories (e.g., Champions, At_risk, etc.). You also create a treemap to visualize the distribution of customer segments.

Analysis of Churn by RFM Score: You analyze the distribution of churned customers based on their RFM scores.

Conversion to RFM Segment: You create an 'RFM_Segment' column by concatenating 'R', 'F', and 'M' columns to represent each customer's RFM segment.

Segment Analysis: You analyze statistical summaries of RFM parameters for each RFM segment and RFM score.

Customer Segmentation with K-Means: You mention the potential use of K-Means clustering for customer segmentation and provide steps for data preparation before applying K-Means.

Distribution Visualization: You create visualizations to show the distribution of 'Recency', 'Frequency', and 'MonetaryValue'.

Summary Statistics: You provide summary statistics for the 'Recency', 'Frequency', and 'MonetaryValue' columns.
